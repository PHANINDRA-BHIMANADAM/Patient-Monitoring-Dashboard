# Patient-Monitoring-Dashboard

Patient monitoring dashboard using machine learning and visualization techniques to analyze Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) needs.

**Problem**

With the rise of digital healthcare, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is becoming essential. However, identifying which patients truly require RPM remains a challenge.
This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses patient data and determines the need for RPM.

**Solution**
**The solution includes:**

✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering

✅ Predictive model using Random Forest Classifier

✅ Visual analytics for insights on RPM usage trends

✅ Exportable model for future real-world applications

**Tools and Platforms Used**
Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier 🌳

Platform: Google Colab
